# Terminal_Shopping

This is my FIRST self-guided project!  
Shop through a rough recreation of an Aldi grocery store and complete your shopping experience by checking out at the register.

While working through the CodeCademy Computer Science career path, at about 20% through, I was instructed to create a super small 'project' using OOP and to have at least 2 classes and a few instances and methods for those classes.  For whatever reason, I just decided to keep going and create a text-based terminal game/adventure where you can move from aisle to aisle, shop the store, remove items from your cart, and go through the checkout process, which is the final point of the 'shopping experience'.  

I didn't have nearly any experience with OOP before this, other than what I learned from freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python course, and what I had learned in the first 20% of the CodeCademy Computer Science career path, so it is pretty messy and overcomplicated.  After finishing the project, I realized I could have used so much less code to accomplish the same thing, but we have to start somewhere, I'm just glad it's functional!  

When the user is in shop mode, to add an item to the cart, make sure to include the entire name of the item (including the parentheses) or it will say the item doesn't exist.  The case doesn't have to be exact to work.  

Future changes:
- Shorten and simplify code (add functions, etc.)
- Create better shopping functionality (selecting items easier, etc.)
- improve reciept format
